    // Part 1: True or False (Questions 1-20)
    { id: 1, type: 'tf', question: "In traditional databases, data is stored before schemas are defined.", options: ["True", "False"], answer: "False", explanation: "Traditional relational databases (like SQL) require a schema to be defined *before* data can be stored. This is known as 'schema-on-write'." },
    { id: 2, type: 'tf', question: "The HDFS file system cannot store a large number of small files.", options: ["True", "False"], answer: "False", explanation: "HDFS *can* store a large number of small files, but it is highly inefficient. Each file consumes metadata memory on the NameNode, which can become a bottleneck. It's a performance issue, not a hard limitation." },
    { id: 3, type: 'tf', question: "HDFS has the multi-copy mechanism. So, there is no single point of failure.", options: ["True", "False"], answer: "False", explanation: "The multi-copy (replication) mechanism protects against DataNode failures. However, in a standard HDFS setup, the NameNode itself is a single point of failure (SPOF). High-availability configurations are needed to mitigate this." },
    { id: 4, type: 'tf', question: "The essence of metadata persistence is to flush data from memory to disks.", options: ["True", "False"], answer: "True", explanation: "Persistence means making data durable. For metadata (like in HDFS's NameNode), this involves writing it from volatile memory to non-volatile disk storage (e.g., EditLog and FsImage)." },

While it stores data in column families, it is fundamentally a key-value store." },
    { id: 7, type: 'tf', question: "The Partition, Sort, Combine, and Spill steps are mandatory in the Map phase.", options: ["True", "False"], answer: "False", explanation: "The Combine step is optional.

    { id: 8, type: 'tf', question: "The stage division of Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs) depends on wide dependency.", options: ["True", "False"], answer: "True", explanation: "In Spark, a new stage is created whenever a wide dependency (shuffle) is encountered. Narrow dependencies can be executed within the same stage." },
    { id: 9, type: 'tf', question: "Flink stream processing APIs are DataSet APIs.", options: ["True", "False"], answer: "False", explanation: "Flink's stream processing API is the DataStream API. The DataSet API is for batch processing." },

    { id: 13, type: 'tf', question: "Kafka is a distributed publish-subscribe messaging system. It publishes but does not store messages.", options: ["True", "False"], answer: "False", explanation: "A key feature of Kafka is that it *does* store messages durably on disk for a configurable retention period, allowing consumers to read them later." },
    { id: 14, type: 'tf', question: "ClickHouse implements the replicated table mechanism based on the ReplicatedMergeTree engine and ZooKeeper. When creating a table, you can specify an engine to determine whether the table is highly available. The shards and replicas of each table are independent of each other.", options: ["True", "False"], answer: "True", explanation: "This correctly describes how ClickHouse achieves high availability and replication using the ReplicatedMergeTree engine family and ZooKeeper for coordination." },
    { id: 15, type: 'tf', question: "Elasticsearch is a full-text search service built on Apache Lucene and can be used as a NoSQL database.", options: ["True", "False"], answer: "True", explanation: "Elasticsearch is built on the Lucene library and provides a distributed, document-oriented NoSQL database with powerful search capabilities." },

    { id: 18, type: 'tf', question: "DataArts Studio is a one-stop data governance and operations platform that provides intelligent data lifecycle management to help enterprises achieve digital operations.", options: ["True", "False"], answer: "True", explanation: "This is the primary value proposition of DataArts Studio." },
    { id: 19, type: 'tf', question: "In a relational database, multiple complex indexes can be built for different columns, while HBase has only one index, that is, row key.", options: ["True", "False"], answer: "True", explanation: "By default, HBase data is indexed only by its row key. Secondary indexes can be implemented but require additional solutions." },
    { id: 20, type: 'tf', question: "MRS supports the decoupling of storage and compute resources, significantly improving the resource utilization of big data clusters.", options: ["True", "False"], answer: "True", explanation: "Decoupling storage (like OBS) and compute allows for independent scaling of resources, which is a key advantage of cloud-based big data platforms like MRS." },
