    { id: 51, type: 'tf', question: "With the development of cloud computing technologies, computing that used to be serverless is now performed on virtual machines (VMs).", options: ["True", "False"], answer: "False", explanation: "The trend is the opposite. Serverless computing (like FunctionGraph) is an evolution that abstracts away VMs, allowing users to run code without managing servers." },
    { id: 52, type: 'tf', question: "In the Docker environment, cgroups encapsulate kernel resources so that each container has independent resources and different processes do not interfere with each other when using the same resource in their own space.", options: ["True", "False"], answer: "False", explanation: "This describes namespaces. Cgroups (control groups) are used to limit and monitor resource usage (CPU, memory) for a group of processes." },
    { id: 53, type: 'tf', question: "Serverless computing provides a mini-architecture. End users do not need to deploy, configure, or manage servers. The servers required for code running are provided by the cloud platform.", options: ["True", "False"], answer: "True", explanation: "This is the core concept of serverless computing, focusing on functions and events rather than infrastructure management." },
    { id: 54, type: 'tf', question: "You can configure security groups and network ACLs to protect ECSs in your VPCs. Security groups protect ECSs, and network ACLs protect subnets.", options: ["True", "False"], answer: "True", explanation: "This correctly describes the two layers of firewall protection in a VPC: stateful security groups at the instance level and stateless network ACLs at the subnet level." },
    { id: 55, type: 'tf', question: "Log Tank Service (LTS) collects, stores, and queries cloud resource operation records... The default storage duration is seven days. To store traces for longer, configure a tracker to transfer traces to Object Storage Service (OBS) buckets.", options: ["True", "False"], answer: "False", explanation: "This describes Cloud Trace Service (CTS), which tracks operation records (traces). LTS is for collecting and managing application and system logs." },
    { id: 56, type: 'tf', question: "The monolithic architecture is a service-oriented architecture that features loose coupling, simple structure, and easy deployment and upgrade, and uses an enterprise service bus (ESB) for communication between services.", options: ["True", "False"], answer: "False", explanation: "This describes a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA). A monolithic architecture is tightly coupled, with all components deployed as a single unit." },
    { id: 57, type: 'tf', question: "If an Elastic Volume Service (EVS) disk space is insufficient, you can increase the disk size by expanding capacity. If there is too much available space, you can reduce the disk size.", options: ["True", "False"], answer: "False", explanation: "You can expand an EVS disk's capacity online, but you cannot reduce (shrink) its size." },
    { id: 58, type: 'tf', question: "Four types of networks are available for Bare Metal Server (BMS): Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), advanced network, user-defined VLAN, and BI network.", options: ["True", "False"], answer: "False", explanation: "The standard network types for BMS are typically VPC, management network, and high-performance network. The listed options are not the standard classification." },
    { id: 59, type: 'tf', question: "Cloud Firewall (CFW) mainly protects Internet borders and VPC borders, while Web Application Firewall (WAF) mainly protects web services, domain names, or IP addresses.", options: ["True", "False"], answer: "True", explanation: "This correctly distinguishes the roles of CFW (network-level border protection) and WAF (application-level web protection)." },
    { id: 60, type: 'tf', question: "Unlike using traditional databases, customers using cloud databases only need to pay for DB instances. They do not need to purchase or install any hardware or software. Using cloud databases makes O&M less expensive.", options: ["True", "False"], answer: "True", explanation: "This accurately summarizes the value proposition of managed cloud database services like RDS, which reduce capital expenditure and operational overhead." }
