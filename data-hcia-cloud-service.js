The listener forwards the request to the corresponding backend server group based on the configured request. If no forwarding policy is configured, the request will not be forwarded."], explanation: "A listener is tied to a specific port and protocol, so it can only handle one type of service traffic. A listener has a default backend server group, so requests will be forwarded even without a specific forwarding policy." },
