The difference between logistic regression and linear regression is that they have different loss functions.", options: ["True", "False"], answer: "False", explanation: "The key difference is that logistic regression uses a sigmoid (or similar) function to output a probability for classification, whereas linear regression outputs a continuous value." },
    { id: 55, type: 'tf', question: "Cloud Trace Service (CTS) records, queries, and transfers audit logs, encrypts trace files, and notifies users of key operations.", options: ["True", "False"], answer: "True", explanation: "This accurately describes the core capabilities of CTS for auditing and tracking operations on the cloud platform." },
    { id: 56, type: 'tf', question: "A single-layer perceptron is a linear model but it can solve a nonlinear data problem such as exclusive OR.", options: ["True", "False"], answer: "False", explanation: "The XOR problem is a classic example of a non-linearly separable problem, which cannot be solved by a single-layer perceptron." },
    { id: 57, type: 'tf', question: "The main purpose of adding an activation function to a neural network is to transform it into a nonlinear model.", options: ["True", "False"], answer: "True", explanation: "Without non-linear activation functions, a deep neural network would just be a complex linear model, unable to learn complex patterns." },
    { id: 58, type: 'tf', question: "Automated scaling is restricted to adding cloud servers. Capacity reduction must be managed by users manually.", options: ["True", "False"], answer: "False", explanation: "Auto Scaling (AS) handles both scaling out (adding servers) and scaling in (removing servers) automatically based on configured policies." },
    { id: 59, type: 'tf', question: "The default block size in HDFS for Hadoop 2.x is 256 MB, which means that files are split into multiple blocks serving as storage units.", options: ["True", "False"], answer: "False", explanation: "The default block size in HDFS for Hadoop 2.x is 128 MB, not 256 MB." },
    { id: 60, type: 'tf', question: "Flink programs consist of three parts: Source, Transformation, and Sink. Sink is responsible for reading data from data sources such as HDFS, Kafka, and text.", options: ["True", "False"], answer: "False", explanation: "The Source is responsible for reading data. The Sink is responsible for writing the results to an external system." }
